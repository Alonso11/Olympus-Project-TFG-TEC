## Overview

This repository contains the development of the Final Graduation Project (TFG) for the Olympus Project. The project is based on the application of Systems Engineering methodologies for the design, analysis, and execution of complex technological solutions.

The main focus lies on requirements traceability, modular architecture design, and systematic validation processes to ensure system integrity.

---

## Systems Engineering Methodology

The development cycle is governed by the following engineering pillars:
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identification and management of critical needs.
- **Requirements Engineering**: Rigorous definition of functional and technical specifications.
- **Architecture Design**: Modular structuring following industry standards.
- **Validation**: Systematic validation procedures to ensure quality and stakeholder needs are met.
